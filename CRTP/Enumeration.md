PowerView is a PowerShell tool to gain network situational awareness on Windows domains. It contains a set of pure-PowerShell replacements for various windows “net *” commands, which utilize PowerShell AD hooks and underlying Win32 API functions to perform useful Windows domain functionality. Several functions for the enumeration and abuse of domain trusts also exist Download script
